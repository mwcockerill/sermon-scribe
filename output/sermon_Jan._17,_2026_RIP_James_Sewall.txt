In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. When Jesus finally arrives in Bethany, Lazarus had been dead four days. Martha goes out to meet him and says words that are faithful, aching, and painfully honest: "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died." Those words ring true for anyone who has ever stood at a grave, sat at the bedside of someone dying, or waited and wondered where God was in the middle of suffering. Martha believes in Jesus. She trusts him. And yet, she does not pretend that everything is fine. She names her loss plainly. But then she adds two quiet, powerful words: "even now." Even now, I know that God will give you whatever you ask of him.

That phrase "even now" sits at the heart of the Christian faith in the face of death. It holds together grief and hope, loss and trust, honesty and belief. It does not deny death's reality, but it refuses to grant death the final word. Jim Suol knew something about waiting. For many years of his later life, his world became smaller. He wasn't able to do much of anything physically, much less come to church. And yet, he was not forgotten. He was visited. He was prayed with. He was known. When his body no longer allowed him to come to church, the church came to him.

In today's world, there is a temptation at funerals to rush too quickly to the resurrection, to skip past the ache and get straight to the alleluyas. But Jesus does not do that with Martha. He hears her lament. He receives her disappointment. And only then does he speak words of astonishing promise: "I am the resurrection and the life." Notice what Jesus does not say. He doesn't say, "I will bring resurrection someday," or "resurrection will happen eventually." He says, "I am." Yes, the resurrection of the body will happen at the last day, but resurrection in this case is a person who comes to meet us. 

And that is why those two words "even now" mean so much when we turn from Martha's story to Jim's. Jim's life, especially toward the end, may not have looked very dramatic from the outside. There were no grand adventures, no visible accomplishments, no long list of achievements to recite. But the Christian faith has never measured the value of life by productivity, strength, or independence. A human life matters because it is loved by God. Jim certainly mattered to those who cared for him, including Daniel, his longtime social worker, who tended to him with compassion and concern from far back east. I believe he's watching on the livestream. He also mattered to his cousin Rich, who, like Daniel, is joining us from the East Coast. And he mattered to God, not because of what he could do, but because of who he was—a person created in God's image, claimed by and loved by God.

Jesus goes on to say, "Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live." He doesn't deny death. Jim really has died, and we grieve. The loss is real. And yet, as St. Paul reminds us, death has been swallowed up in victory. At the bedside, at the grave, and here at this altar, the church dares to say, "even now." Even now, Christ is present. Even now, Jim's life is held in God's care. Even now, resurrection has begun.

When Jesus asks Martha, "Do you believe this?" she responds not with a doctrinal explanation, but with a confession. Her faith has spoken aloud: "Yes, Lord, I believe." Not because she understands everything, but because she knows Jesus. And that is enough. It was enough for Martha. It is enough for Jim, and it is enough for you and me. 

In a moment, we will commend Jim to Almighty God, entrusting him to the one who is resurrection and life, the one who meets us in our sorrow, our weakness, and our grief. And we will leave this place, not pretending that death does not hurt, but confident that even now, God's mercy is at work. Even now, Christ holds Jim fast. Even now, nothing can separate him from the love of God.
