In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Before Jesus does anything impressive—before he preaches a sermon, before he heals the sick, before he calls his disciples—God the Father speaks. Jesus steps into the muddy waters of the Jordan, standing shoulder to shoulder with sinners, and a voice from heaven says, "This is my Son, the beloved, with whom I am well pleased." God does not wait to see how Jesus performs. God does not say, "This is my Son, with whom I will be pleased, provided everything goes according to plan." God speaks delight first, identity first, love first. Before Jesus does anything at all, God delights in him.

If we're honest, this order feels backwards to most of us. We are deeply formed by the idea that God's love is earned. We start to believe, sometimes without ever saying it out loud, that God is pleased with us if we believe the right things, if we behave well enough, if we avoid certain sins, if we pitch in and do our part. Baptism then can start to feel like a kind of probationary contract, one mistake away from being revoked. God has done God's part, and now the pressure is on us not to mess it all up. This is why renewing our baptismal vows, as we will do in a moment, can feel a bit heavy. We hear these promises, and if we're paying attention, we immediately think, "How in the world can I possibly live up to all of this? And what happens when I don't?"

That question is precisely why Matthew gives us this strange, unsettling scene at the River Jordan. John the Baptist knows what his baptism is for—sinners stepping into a muddy river for the forgiveness of sins. And Jesus most certainly does not belong in that category. So when Jesus comes to be baptized, John tries to stop him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?" In other words, this is out of order. This doesn't compute. This isn't how all of this works. And Jesus responds, "Let it be so now, for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness." 

In Matthew's Gospel, righteousness does not mean being morally impressive before others. It means being faithfully aligned with God's saving purpose. Jesus steps into the water not because he needs to repent, but because we do. Jesus goes where sinners go. He stands where broken people stand. From the very beginning, he refuses to save us from a distance. Jesus stands with us sinners so that sinners may stand with him. And it is there, in that muddy ordinary water, that God speaks delight. God's delight is not a reward for a proper spiritual life; it is a declaration of identity. God calls Jesus his beloved Son before Jesus does anything at all.

For some of us, this image of God as Father, followed by words like beloved and delight, doesn't seem to make sense in light of our relationship with our earthly fathers. For some, this fatherly relationship brings up difficult memories and emotions. Think of the ridiculousness of the father in the story of the prodigal son. The son got his inheritance in advance and went and squandered it before his father even died. And after all of that, the father literally ran out to meet him when he returned home. God, the Father's love for us is absolutely ridiculous and unfathomable. This scriptural metaphor does not mean that all human fathers reflect God faithfully, and on the flip side, God's delight is not dependent on our having had a perfect experience of love in our life. This promise is for all of us.

It is precisely because human love is imperfect that baptism does not rest on our strength but on the faithfulness of the God who meets us in the water. In the waters of baptism, God does not say, "Let's see how faithful you can be, and then we'll talk." In baptism, God speaks to us first, claims us first, loves us first. The early church had to learn this one the hard way, as Luke reminds us in the book of Acts. Peter, standing in the house of Cornelius, has a realization: "I truly understand that God shows no partiality." Peter is not converted by a convincing argument but by the Spirit showing up where he never expected. God's delight is wider than Peter could ever imagine. God's grace moves faster than the church is comfortable with. 

Suddenly, it becomes clear that baptism is not something reserved for those who behave a certain way but a free gift given to all who ask, especially the worst of sinners. Because if God delights in us before we achieve anything, then the church cannot turn baptism into a test of worthiness. And if God shows no partiality, then baptism dismantles every hierarchy of human value we can construct—racial, economic, ethnic, moral, cultural. The baptismal font is the great leveler of human equality.

This brings us to the vows we are about to renew. Listen closely to what we actually promise and how we promise it. We don't say, "I will because I'm strong enough to do it on my own." We say again and again, "I will with God's help." These three words, "with God's help," tell us the truth about ourselves and about God. The Christian life isn't about choosing to do good on our own; it is about cooperating with God's grace—God's grace at God's initiative, sustained by his mercy, and lived out in fragile and broken human lives. 

That means that these vows are not conditions of God's delight. They describe what the Christian life looks like when you know you are already loved. We don't resist evil to make God love us; we resist evil because we are already loved. We don't seek Christ in all persons to earn our place in the church; we do it because Christ has already claimed us as his own. We don't act justly and love mercy in order to impress God; we do it because God's unconditional love for us is so overwhelming that we can't help but share it with those around us.

God's delight does not remove our responsibility to do good; it makes obedience something that we can actually attempt to begin. It gives us the courage to repent when we fall, the freedom to tell the truth about ourselves and the world around us, the strength to love our neighbors as ourselves, and the humility to keep trying even when we fail. 

And so, dear friends, we return today to the font. In so doing, we remember who we are. We are standing again in the muddy waters of the Jordan, where heaven was once opened. And before we promise anything, God has already spoken: "You are my beloved."
